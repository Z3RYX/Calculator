# Calculator

Welcome to my work in progress C# calculator

Right now you can only have one operation in the equasion (e.g. 376*123-3 won't work)

# Known bugs
- Pressing the arrow buttons will type + or 0
- Title will change to number (it's technically not a bug but I'm too lazy to fix it now)
- 0 can be added multiple times after an operator
